This project is a replica of flipkart, designed to replicate its core functionalities and user experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website prioritizes user-friendliness and responsiveness. Key features include product listings, shopping cart, and user authentication. While adhering to standard development practices, subtle UI enhancements and a "back to top" button distinguish this project.
